I am a DevOps/Cloud Engineer, primarily using Azure and Azure DevOps. This
blog exists to share any useful tricks or techniques that I find or come up
with.

Prior to my current role, my work background is a mix of Software Engineering
(Python, some Java, a little C# and VB.NET) and IT infrastructure and support.
